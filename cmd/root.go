	Use:   "jarvis",
	Short: "Assist you to read ethereum contract and do ethereum tx easily",
	Long: `Jarvis is a command line tool to assist ethereum dapp operators to do their
daily tasks such as reading smart contracts and doing operational transactions.

Jarvis supports you on different ends:

	1. It manages your ethereum accounts so you dont have to
	remember which address is with which kind of key like keystores,
	trezor, ledger....

	2. It manages a book of addresses so you will not forget one, easily
	look them up and will show you address information to improve tx's
	verbosity.

	3. It helps you to read smart contract and do transactions with
	intuitive command line interface.
